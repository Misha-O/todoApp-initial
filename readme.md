This is my initial todo list app, the main idea was to explore different methods
and logic needed to implement certain features.

- no dependencies, written in Vanilla JS;

## App features:

- add todos by typing into input field;
- edit todo by clicking "pencil icon", content will appear in the input field,
  after editting, click edit task button once again to confirm;
- sort lists by choosing all or only completed;
- use delete/edit/complete feature directly on your todo, using respective
  icons;
- by clicking delete bin icon it only removes todo from display, but it still
  remains within memory;
- there is also an option to use dropzone to your right to remove respective
  todo;
- to completely erase all todos from memory click "Erase tasks from memory"
  button at the bottom;
- to mark todo as complete, click "checkmark" icon;
- you can change the order of todos by simply dragging and dropping respective
  todo, also you can shuffle it between "All Your Tasks" list and "Your
  Completed Tasks";
